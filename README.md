# Your Health Website

This project involves creating a simple three page website for an imaginary health care business - YourHealth Ltd.  A logo, copy, and basic image assets were provided, with limited creative guidance.  The whole application is built in React, bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Brief

* The webpage should have 3 pages; *Home page*, *About us*, *Contact*.
* The links should appear in a sidebar on the left.
* The company logo should be displayed in the top left of every page.
* The web page MUST work on mobile, tablet and desktop. 
* We have included some assets for use on the website. 
* The contact page should have a form so user can get in touch with us, our address and a map. 
* Technology The website should be pure HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
* You can use 3rd party javascript libraries but you should justify why it is the correct library for the job. 
* All 3rd party libraries must be included in the delivery 
* Delivery The completed webpage should be delivered via source control (such as GitHub or Bitbucket) and optionally hosted in live demo form if you have a file host to upload it to. 
* We do not expect you to implement the web form sending functionality. Just the display of the form is required.
* The sidebar must be black.
* The main content background must be white.
